So I go checking for e-mail and for some reason my password wasn't working. And I was like, WTF?

So I hit up the Bluehost folks, and they're like, 'Dude, you're not hosting with us'. And I was like 'Wait, what are you talking about?'

And as I was typing those words out, I remembered this little science project I'm sharing with you here and had a palm-to-forehead moment.

Turns out I am able to still host harryduran.com with Netlify, but I had to create what's known as 'A' and 'MX' records so that I can have Bluehost continue to manage my email.

I mean, what better way to spend a Sunday afternoon, right?
