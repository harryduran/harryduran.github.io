OK, let me re-phrase that.

I signed up for this approach, knowing it was not going to be easy. I mean, who actually wants to go back to manually typing in filenames for blog posts.

This guy! üëàüèº

So now I have to figure out something so incredibly basic, like how to change the favicon image on my site, so that when you see it in the browser, it shows 'HD'.

You would think that would be easy, but no. [GitHub](github.com) is great for typing text, but it's not a repository to hold and serve files. That's where [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com) comes in. Now I just need to figure out how to install a CMS.

More to come...
