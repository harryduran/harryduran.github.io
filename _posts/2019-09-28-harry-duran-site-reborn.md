Well here goes. It's been long overdue, and looks like the stars aligned for me to get this up the right way. Hand-coded, and learning as I go.

Much credit goes to Brian Casel, Founder of [ProcessKit](https://processkit.com), whose recent YouTube post, [My 2019 stack for designing & building websites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFFi8MGgx_k) really inspired me to get started.

That let me Jonathan McGlone's tutorial [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). And so here we are.

This blog will start to document that journey, so you're more than welcome to follow along.

I'll look to be hosting the site on [Netlify](netlify.com) (no idea how to do that yet), and according to Jonathan's tutorial, it'll be powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (does that mean there's a software called Hyde floating around somewhere?...) I am also familiarizing myself more with Markdown to author my posts, so this [Printable Markdown Cheatsheet](http://packetlife.net/media/library/16/Markdown.pdf) will definitely come in handy!

It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be! Best of all I'm learning a new skillset!

OK, enough with the overused exclamation points!
