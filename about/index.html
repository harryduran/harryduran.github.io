Welcome! If you've made it to this page, no doubt you're a bit curious about me. I'm sure this will continue to evolve, but we'll keep it simple for now.
I've been the Host of [Podcast Junkies](http://podcastjunkies.com) since 2014. It's a meta podcast where I've had the privilege (at last count) to have interviewed over 200 luminaries in the podcasting space. I encourage you to [subscribe here on your favorite podcast app](http://pjnk.es/subscribe).
I'm also the Founder of [FullCast](http://fullcast.co), our full-service podcast production and marketing agency.
